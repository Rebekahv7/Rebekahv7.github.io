					<h3>Home</h3>
						<p>This website contains many of my favorite projects that I have completed this semester in Seventh Grade Technology.There are projects from each unit that was completed in this class. </p> 
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>Over this year I have learned about Image Manipulation, Making 3D Models, and learning HTML as well as Bootstrap, CSS, and Javascript. I have learned to use different programs for each unit that are very useful.</p>

			<h3>Image Manipulation</h3>
				<p>The Image Manipulation Unit started at the beginning of the semester, it was the first unit that we learned about.This unit includes pictures that I created with photo editing and manipulating programs such as Photoshop. Through out the unit we learned specifically about how to change certin aspects of photos to make them appear different. At the beginning of the year I did not know anything about Image manipulation  but now, at the end of the year, I know how to do many different things in order to change the appearance of a picture. For example, I know how to change the colors of different items, and how to remove an alpha layer.My goals for next year are to not forget anything that I have learned in this unit. I would also like to be able to learn more about each of the tools we used.Next year I hope that I will be able to learn more about Image Manipulation and get better. </p>
				<br>
				<p> These are two of my favorite projects from the beginning of this project. </p>

			<h3>Round Robin</h3>
				<p>The Round Robin project is a project where we applied our HTML knowlage to other classes. We picked two subjects out of a long list and made HTML websites for them. Our options included art, History, Language Arts, Music, Science and many more. For my first site I created a story under the catagory of creative writing. Then, I got better at coding and created my second website, which is on Plantes and their greek god.Next year, I would like to be able to remember the code for specific things without haveing to look them up. I would also like to learn more JavaScript and Bootstrap as well. One thing that I really want to improve on is CSS, I do not use much in my websites but I would like to. Overall, I would like to expand my knowlage of HTML 5.  </p>

			<p> This was one of two models that I put into my website </p>
				This website is my second of two submissions for the Round Robin Assignment. This is specifically on Jupiter. 
				<p> Although I could not publsih my website because it was not working correctly, these are screen shots from the page. </p>

			<h3>3D Modeling</h3>
				<p>In this unit we used Blender, 3DS Max and Unreal to make objects depending on the assignment. For example, in the beginning of the unit we made a coffe cup, and a snowman and then imported them into Unreal 4. Just recently we worked on making more advanced things that take more time. These assignments prepared us for later assignments.Eventually, the whole class made Hardware models and put them into websites. Next year I would like to learn the programs a little bit more so I can understand how to do most things without having to look at tutorials. Next year I would also like to be better at 3D modeling. I would like to know how to use most if not all of the tools and be able to make things without the help of my father.</p>
				<p> The first picture is a picture of a teddy bear that I made in Blende, this was the first assignment that I did in this unit. The next picture is a Motherboard I also made in blender.</p>

			<h3>Hardware Chart</h3>
				<p>The Hardware chart was the last assignment in the Hardware Module. The hardware pieces I chose were the Motherboard, Hard disk drive, DVD Drive, Power Supply and RAM (Random Access Memory). It was a chart that had five or six hardware components and information on them as well. There are five different catagories which include the name of the item, a blender model, purpose, price, and how delicate each item is. Next year I would like to learn more about each different piece of hardware. For example, I would like to learn the specific places that each part can go in a tower, or how each connects to the other. We did not have much time to really look at the Hardware and learn a lot about it, but I did end up learning much more than I expected or already knew.  </p>

			<h3>Unreal Project</h3>
				<p>The Unreal prohect was a project where the students were put into groups and built a specific place of mars. Each ground also had a biosphere that was built onto the surface of mars. We had to figure out how oxygen would get into the biosphere, how they would get clean water, how the people there would be intertained, and many more things. This put our 3D Modeling skills to the test. My goals for next year are to be able to learn most controls. Also, I would like to be able to make things that are somewhat more 'advanced.' I would like to use the program more in general. </p>
				<p> I do not have any pictures of my Final Unreal prject but I do have pictures of items that I made in Ureal 4. The items in these pictures were made in different assignments. The first picture is a 'showcase' of pre-built models in Ureal. The second picture is a couch (prebuilt) that I add my own texture to. (The texture is a cat.) </p>
